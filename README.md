# Movie_Recommendation_System_Leemo
This is a movie recommendation system. Here the application of natural language processing which is sentiment analysis is implemented along with the machine learning. The created model will be able to recommend a movie based on your interested movies by identifying the genre of that particular movie you searched.

Here we are collecting the datasets from IMdb and TMDB. 
We are doing webscraping to collect the data. The collected data after web scraping is then cleaned and make sure if it's perfect to be passed on to the next level.
The next level is preprocessing of the dataset and then create a model for the recommendation of movies.
